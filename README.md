# About

I agree that 'backpack' is a very business-specific upper-level system and doesn't need to be encapsulated into a generic library. <br/>
**我赞同背包系统非常靠近上层具体业务，通常不需要封装成库。**

However, I'm someone who often acts on new ideas immediately, so I frequently create new projects. <br/>
**但是我是一个想到新点子就想立刻付诸行动的人，所以经常创建新项目。**

To reduce some hassle, I still prefer to encapsulate it for quick restarts.<br/>
**为了让自己少一些麻烦，所以还是封装一个，便于快速重来。**
